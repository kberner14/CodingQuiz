Throughout the course of learning web development, there will be moments when basic skills will need to be tested. Often times, in a classroom or interview environment, these tests will come in the form of multiple choice quizzes. The goal is to create a function quiz that presents the user with questions, possible choices, and replaces both the question and choice upon completion.

  In addition to the basic layout, the created page should link to a highscore page which should have an updating high score sheet that is linked to local files. This way, the user can compare how they did after multiple renditions of running through the quiz. This should all be responsive as well, to help the user who is on the go and on a smaller screen.
